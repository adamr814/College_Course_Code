HW-1	CS451	       10 points	Due: Sept. 4

The intent of this assignment is to write a little program 
that can extract email/web addresses from a web page (just like 
the spiders do that spammers use to get email addresses).

Part 1:
Write a program that uses the system call "system" to execute the 
command WGET. WGET must download the following page.

http://undcemcs01.und.edu/~ronald.marsh/PROJECTS/PROJECTS.HTML

* Note that WGET MUST operate in quite mode to get full credit!

Part 2:
Add to the program a section that loads and parses the downloaded
file extracting all of the project names. Your program must
generate a listing on the screen of the extracted project names 
when it is run.

* Note that the web list must be perfect - no extra characters -
to get full credit.

Part 3:
Add to the program a section that removes the downloaded file using
UNLINK.


REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
1. Your program must run on Linux Mint.

2. Your full name must appear as a comment at the beginning of your 
   program.

3. Your source code must be named hw1-yourname.c or hw1-yourname.cpp
