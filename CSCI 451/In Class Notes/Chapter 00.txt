unix introduction:
- process commands
    ps displays processes
    -f displays all processes
    -A displays all processes running on the machine

- redirection lets you redirect from standard I/O 
    < redirect standard input
    > or 1> redirect standard output (overwrite)
    >> or 1>> (append)
    2> redirect standard error (overwrite)
    2>> redirect (append)

    format: command < input > output
    cat < file_in > file_out

    ls -1 ~ lists vertically

    pipes:
    redirects output from one program into another
    Format: command | command

    ls | more
    cat < source_file | sort
    cat < source_file | sort > result_file

    aliases can be used to define new names for commonly used commands

    links: links allow the creation of an aliases or nicknames for a file.
    
    permissions:
        ls -la ~ gives all information of all files in directory
        can use chmod to change permissions
        chmod 755 file_name ~ is very useful

        ./dump ~ has a script within it
        chmod 755 dump ~ makes the file executeable (like a bash script)
