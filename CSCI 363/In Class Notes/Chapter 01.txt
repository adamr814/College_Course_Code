Key point, try to gain the understanding of what the customer really wants rather than what we think it should be.

Software development:
    - the economies of all developed nations are dependent on software
    - more and more systems are software controlled
    - software engineering is connected with theories methods and tools for professional software development
    - expenditure on software represents a significant fraction of GNP in all developed countries.

Software Costs:
    - software costs often dominate computer system costs. the costs of software on a pc is greater than the hardware cost
    - software costs more to maintain than it does to develop. for systems with a long life, maintenance

FAQ's about software development:
    - 

What is software:
    - computer programs and associated documentation such as requirements, design models and user manuals
    - software products may be developed for a particular customer or may be developed for a general market
    - software products may be
        - generic: developed to be sold to a range of different customers
        - Bespoke (custom): developed for a single customer according to their specification

What is software engineering:
    - software engineering is an engineering discipline

what is the difference between software engineering and computer science:
    - computer science is concerned with theory and fundamentals, software engineering is concerned with the practicabilities of developing
    and delivering useful software

    - Computer science theories are still insufficient to act as a complete underpinning for software engineering (unlike e.g. 
    physics and electrical engineering)

What is the difference between software engineering and system engineering:
    - system engineering is concerned with all aspects of computer-based systems development including hardware, software and process
    engineering, software engineering is part of this process concerned with developing the software infrastructure

What is a software process:
    - a set of activities whose goal is the development or evolution of software
    - generic activities in all software processes are:
        - specification: wht the system should do and its development constraints
        - development: production of the software system
        - validation: checking that the software is what the customer wants
        - evolution: changing the software in response to changing demands

What is a software process model:
    - a simplified representation of software process, presented from a specific perspective
    - examples of process perspectives are
        - workflow perspective: sequence of activities
        - dataflow perspective: information flow
        - role/ action
