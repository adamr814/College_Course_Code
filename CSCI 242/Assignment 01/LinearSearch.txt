Assignment 1

array -> [x, y, z...] #inialize array of values 
i -> 0 #initialize increment number
searchVal -> val #the value we are searching for

while i <= length of array:
    if array at index i = searchVal:
        print(value was found)
    break

    else:
        print(value was not found)

    i += 1 #increment value up by 1 to search next element in array

Time Complexity:
array init     -> f(x) = 1
i init         -> f(x) = 1
searchVal init -> f(x) = 1
while loop     -> f(x) = n
if else        -> f(x) = 1
i increment    -> f(x) = 1

f(x) = 5 + n -> O(n)

Linear search algorithm runs on O(n) time.
