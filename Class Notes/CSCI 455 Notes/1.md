**Databases and Database Users**
Introduction
- Data is everywhere and comes in different shapes and sizes
	- The data needs to be stored and maintained using a database management system
- Databases
	- used to maintain information and present data to users
- Examples of databases include
	- reservation systems (hotel, car, airline)
	- transactional processing systems (online banking systems)

Recent Developments
- social networks: started storing a lot of information about people (e.g. tweets, posts, photos, videos, etc.)
	- facebook
	- twitter
	- linkedin
- all of the above constitutes data
- search engines such as google, yahoo

- new technologies known as non-database platforms are emerging to manage vast amounts of data generated on the web:
	- big data storage systems involve large clusters of distributed computers (ch 25)
	- NoSQL (not only sql) systems (ch24)

Core DataBase terminologies
- data:
	- any information (most likely in electronic form) worth preserving
- database:
	- a collection of related data describing the activities of one or more orgizations
		- organized for access and preservation
- query
	- an operation that extracts specific data from the database
- relation
	- an organization of data into a two dimensional table
	- rows (tuples) represent basic entities or facts of some sot
	- columns (attributed or fields) represents properties of those entities
- schema:
	- a description of the structure of the data in a database
	- also known as metadata

Database properties
- a database must
	- represent some aspects of the real world
	- the collection of data must be logically coherent and meaningful
	- designed, build, and populated with data for a specific purpose

Database construction
- the database can be constructed
	- manually
		- eg a library card catalog
	- computerized
		- specialized DB
			- a specific set of applications
		- general purpose DB
			- DBMS

Typical DBMS Functionality
- define a particular database in terms of its data types, structures, and constraints.
- construct or load the initial database contents on a secondary storage medium
- manipulating the database:
	- retrieving: querying, generating reports
	- modifying: inserting, deleting, and updating its content
	- accessing: accessing the database through web applications
- processing and sharing by a set of concurrent users and application programs - yet, keeping all data valid and consistent.

Additional DBMS Functionality
- DBMS may additionally provide:
	- protection or security measures to prevent unauthorized access
	- presentation and visualization of data
	- maintenance of the database and associated programs over the lifetime of the database application

Database Engineering
- design of any DB application includes:
	- requirements definition and analysis
		- use case diagrams scenario, etc
	- conceptual design
		- initial solution modeling using entity relationship diagram (ERD) or unified modeling language (UML)
	- logical design
		- performed using oracle, mysquel, etc.
	- physical design
		- storing/accessing/indexing

Main characteristics of the database approach
- self describing nature of a database system:
	- a DBMS catalog stores the description of a particular database
	- the description is called metadata
	- this allows the DBMS software to work with different database applications
- insulation between programs and data:
	- called program-data independence
	- allows changing data structures and storage organization without having to change the DBMS access programs
- data abstraction:
	- a data model hides storage details and presents the users with a conceptual view of the database
	- programs refer to the data model constructs rather than data storage details
- support multiple views of the data:
	- each user may see a different view of the database, which describes only the data of interest to that user

Support multiple views
- a typical database has many users

Sharing of data and multiuser transaction processing
- a multiuser DBMS must allow multiple users to access data simultaneously
- DBMS must support the **concurrency control** subsystem to ensure the correctness of results performed by updating operations.
- CC plays a key role in online transaction processing systems.
	- works with the notion of **transaction**
	- DBMS enforces **ACID properties** of the transaction

Database users
- users may be divided into two categories:
	- actors on the scene: those who use, control the database content, design, develop, and maintain database applications
	- actors behind the scene: those who design and develop the DBMS software and related tools, and the computer systems operators.
- database administrators:
	- responsible for authorizing access to the database for coordinating and monitoring its use, acquiring software and hardware resources
- end users: they use the data for queries, and reports and some of the update the database content
- end users ban be categorized into:
	- casual
	- naive
	- sophisticated
	- stand alone
- system analyst and application developers (accounts)
	- systems a
- system designers
- tool developers
- operators and maintenance personnel

Primary advantages of using a DBMS
- controlling redundancy
	- duplicate space and efforts, inconsistency etc.
	- normalization vs denormalization 
- restricting unauthorized access
- providing persistent storage for program objects and data structure
	- impedance mismatch problem
- providing view to generate new information from existing ones
- providing multiple user interfaces
- representing complex relationships among data
- enforcing integrity constraints
- providing backup and crash recovery
- scheduling concurrent accesses to the data
- reducing application development time
