### Objectives
- What we mean by software engineering
- software engineering's track record
- What we mean by software and good software
- Key concepts

### Definitions: Software
- Software is:
	- Instructions (computer programs) that when executed provide desired features, function, and performance;
	- data structures that enable the programs to adequately manipulate information and
	- documentation that describes the operation and use of the programs
- Software products may be
	- Generic
	- Custom
- New software can be created
	- developing new programs
	- configuring generic software systems
	- reusing existing software

### Attributes of good software
The software should deliver the required capability and quality
**Quality?**
The degree to which a system, component, or process meets specified requirements
**Examples of quality**
- Dependability/Reliability: being trustworthy
- Efficiency: not making wasteful use of system resources
- Usability: being accepted by the users for which it was designed.
- maintainability: software must evolve to meet changing needs

### Software Engineering (SE)
- Software engineering
	- an engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production
	- apply systematic and organized approaches and tools to solve the problem
- The IEEE definition
	- The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development , operation and maintenance of software; that is, the application of engineering to software.

### Manufacturing vs. Development
- once a hardware product has been manufactured, it is difficult to impossible to modify
- software products are routinely modified and upgraded
- in hardware
	- adding more people allows us to accomplish more work
- in software
	- adding more people to a late software project makes it later
- software costs are concentrated in design rather than production

### Component-Based vs. Custom-Built
- In hardware products typically employ many standardized design components
- Most software continues to be custom built
- the software industry moving (slowly) toward component-based construction (reuse)

### Generic approach to software development
- software products are large and complex
- development requires analysis and synthesis
	- analysis:
		- decompose a large problem into smaller, understandable pieces
		- the key is the abstraction
	- synthesis:
		- compose software from smaller building blocks
		- the composition (integration) can be challenging

### Software engineering basic concepts
- methodology
	- a set of procedures, notations, and guidelines used to accomplish system's tasks
	- E.g., OO methodology (prompts reuse)
- tool
	- in instrument or automated system for accomplishing something in a better way
	- E.g., CASE tool
- Model (graphic or textual)
	- artifacts to capture essential decisions/features
	- e.g. UML Class diagrams
- Process
	- The set of steps that must be accomplished to complete a task
	- e.g. waterfall model

### Software process?
- a set of activities whose goal is the development or evolution of software:
	- specification
		- what the system should do?
		- what are development constraints
	- construction
		- production of the software system
	- validation
		- checking that the software is what the customer wants
	- evolution
		- changing the software in response to changing demands

### Another generic view of software life cycle
- Another view of the activities:
	- requirement analysis and definition
	- system design
	- program design
	- writing the programs
	- unit testing
	- integration testing
	- system testing
	- system delivery
	- maintenance

### Software Eng. Vs. Computer Science
- Computer science:
	- focusing on computer hardware, compilers, operating systems, and programming languages
- Software engineering:
	- a discipline that utilizes computer and software technologies as problem-solving tools

### How successful software engineering has been
- Perform tasks more quickly and effectively
	- word processing
	- spreadsheets
	- email
- Support advances in medicine, agriculture, transportation, multimedia education and most other industries
- many good stories
- however, the software is not without problems
	- too many software failures

### Failures
- A Fault:
	- occurs when a human makes a mistake, called an error, in performing some software activities
- A Failure:
	- A departure from the system's required behavior

### What do we mean by high-quality software?
- Good software engineering must always include a strategy for producing high-quality software
- Three ways of considering quality
	- the quality of the product
	- the quality of the process
	- the quality of the product in the context of the business environment (i.e., product and services provided by the business in which the software is embedded)

### The Quality of the product
- users judge external characteristics
	- e.g., correct functionality, number of failures, type of failures
- Designers and maintainers judge internal characteristics
	- e.g., types of faults
- Thus different stakeholders may have different criteria
- Quality models relate the user's external view to the developer's internal view

### The quality of the process?
- the quality of the development process is as important as the product quality
	- involving the process improves the quality of the products
- Process modeling will address questions such as
	- where to identify a particular kind of fault
	- how to find faults early
	- when and how to integrate components
	- how do be build fault tolerance

### People involved in software engineering?
- Customer:
	- the company, organization, or person who pays for the software system
- Developer:
	- the company, organization, or person who is building the software system
- User
	- the person or people who will use they system

### Software engineering methods
- software engineering methods?
	- organized ways of producing software,
	- suggestions and guidelines for the process to be followed
	- the notations to be used
- There are about 20 million software developers worldwide, and the number is growing yearly
- It can be guesstimated that there are over 100,000 different methods to develop software since every team has developed its own way of working even if they didn't describe it explicitly

### Software engineering process models or methods
- Waterfall
- Iterative (full system)
- Prototype (evolutionary)
- V-Model
- Agile
- Spiral
