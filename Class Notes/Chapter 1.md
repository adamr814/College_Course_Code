**Definitions: software**
- Software is:
	- instructions that when executed provide desired features function and performance;
	- data structures that enable the programs to adequately manipulate information
	- documentation that describes the operation and use of the programs
- software products may be
	- generic
	- custom

Attributes of good software
the software should deliver to required capability and quality
quality?
the degree to which a system, component or process meets specified requirements
examples of quality
- dependability/reliability: being trustworthy
- efficiency: not making wasteful use of system resources
- usability: being accepted by the users for which it was designed
- maintainability: software must evolve to meet changing needs

Software engineering
- software engineering
	- and engineering dicipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production
	- apply systematic and organized approaches and tools to solve the problem
- the IEEE definition
	- the application of a systematic, discipline quantifiable approach to the development, operation

Manufacturing vs development
- once a hardware product has been manufactured, it is difficult or impossible to modify
- software products are routinely modified and upgraded
- in hardware
	- adding more people allows us to accomplish more work
- in software
	- adding more people to a late software project

Component based vs custom built
- in hardware products typically employ many standardized design components
- most software continues to be custom built
- the software industry moving slowly toward component based construction

Generic approach to software development
- software products are large and complex
- development requires analysis and synthesis
	- analysis
		- decompose a large problem into smaller, understandable pieces
		- the key is abstraction
	- synthesis
		- compose software from smaller building blocks
		- the composition (integration) can be challenging

Software engineering basic concepts
- methodoology
	- a set of procedures, notations, and guidelines used to accomplish system's tasks
