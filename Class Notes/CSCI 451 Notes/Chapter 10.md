**Storage**
To improve disk I/O performance, transfers are performed in units of blocks. Each block is one or more sectors. Sectors range in size from 32 bytes to 8192+ bytes.

To further improve disk I/O performance, buffering is used. Buffers are sections of memory set aside for the use of the disk I/O system. Each buffer holds 1 or more disk blocks.

Double buffering:
- assume there are two or more buffers.
- records generated by a running process are deposited into the first buffer until it is full
- the contents of the first buffer are then transferred to the disk
- while the transfer is being performed, the process continues writing data into the second buffer
- when the second buffer is full (and the data transfer for the first buffer is complete), the contents of the second buffer are transferred to disk.

**Hard Drives:**
the time it takes to access information on a drive is driven by three factors:
- boom seek time
- latency time (rotational delay)
- transmission time

faster spindle speeds reduce latency
seek time is the major factor in drive performance![[IMG_0361.jpg]]

in multi-programmed systems, many processes may be generating drive requests. Since these processes can generate requests faster than they can be serviced by the drive, a queue forms.

to further exacerbate the problem, the intended disk locations will most likely be randomly spread about the disk

if we use a first come first serve approach to fulfilling the drive requests the heads are then forced to dance about the platters to meet the requests. A long, long queue becomes possible. Obviously, we need as a disk scheduling method to combat this problem.
