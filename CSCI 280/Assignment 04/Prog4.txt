Write a program to create a class called Holiday. The object of the class Holiday represents a holiday
during the year. This class has three instance variables:
• name, which is a String representing the name of the holiday
• day, which is an int representing the day of the month of the holiday
• month, which is a String representing the month the holiday is in

1. Write a constructor for the class Holiday, which takes a String representing the name, an int
representing the day, and a String representing the month as its arguments, and sets the class variables
to these values.

2. Write a No-Args constructor for the class Holiday.

2. Write a method inSameMonth, which compares two instances of the class Holiday (the two instances
of the class are the input to the method), and returns the Boolean value true if they have the same
month, and false if they do not.

3. Write a piece of code that creates a Holiday instance with the name “Independence Day”, with the
day “4”, and with the month “July”. Create another Holiday instance with the name “Labor Day”,
with the day “5”, and with the month “September”.

4. Test your class in the main program by calling the function inSameMonth using the two instances
created of the class Holiday
