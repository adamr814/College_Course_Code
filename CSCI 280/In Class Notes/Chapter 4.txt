oop allows you to define new classes from existing classes (inheritence)

procedural paradigm focuses on designing methods and the object oriented paradigm

inheritence enables you to define a general class (i.e. a superclass) and later extend it to a more specalized class (subclasses)

you use a class to model objects of the same type. different classes have some common properties and behaviors
which can be generalized in a class that can be shared by other classes, you can define a specalized class that extends to the generalized
class. the specalized classes inherit the properties and methods from the general class

*Procedure*

we represent classes in a parent child structure (they inherit the everything (methods and values) from the parent classes)

a subclass will only inherit accessable data fields from a parent class (if data is of the type private/protected) protected
data will be accessable to subclasses of the same package.
