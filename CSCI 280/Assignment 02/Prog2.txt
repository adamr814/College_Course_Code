Program #2

Write a program to find the sum of positive numbers.
Ask the user to input numbers and enter a specific character to stop.
If the user enters a negative number, print an error message and ask the user to only enter positive numbers.
The program should not stop if the user enters a negative number, it should print the message and continue getting input numbers from the user.
The program only stops when the user enters the stop character.
When the user enters the stop character, add all the positive numbers entered and ignore the negative numbers.
Print the result of the sum of all the positive numbers entered.
